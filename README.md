# colorful.kst v1

This repository serves an archive for colorful.kst, a custom-built store which sold colorful blocks on SwitchCraft 3. It also featured an ink
cartridge filler, shulker box filler, remote monitoring, and other features.

This project also features an online tracker available for use. It is written in TypeScript using NextJS and Tailwind.

## Using on other servers

You are free to use this shop software on any Minecraft server, and you may use the code in other projects. However, please abide by the license of this repository, and do not use the colorful.kst name. Please come up with something original. :)

## Contributing

Bug fixes and code improvements are likely to be accepted, however new features won't. For new features, I suggest you bring those forth in the colorful.kst v2 repository.
